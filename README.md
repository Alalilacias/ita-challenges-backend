### Description

The ITA-challenges-backend project is built using Java with the Spring Boot framework and reactive programming. It is an
initiative designed specifically for students enrolled in the IT Academy program at Barcelona Activa. 

The primary goal is to provide students with hands-on experience in a real-world development environment, 
simulating scenarios they may encounter in their future careers. 

Simultaneously, students collaborate to create a valuable learning tool for the [ITA challenges application](http://dev.ita-challenges.eurecatacademy.org/ita-challenge/challenges)
dedicated to code and programming coding-challenges. This project involves tackling new features, addressing legacy code, resolving bugs, 
and fostering teamwork. The emphasis is not only on technical proficiency but also on providing a holistic learning experience 
for our students.

This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

For newcomers, we strongly advise reading through all the provided material before diving in.

1. Multiples of 3 or 5
- Description: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

    Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.
    
    Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

2. Disemvowel Trolls
- Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
    
    For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
    
    Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)
    
    Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
    
    Happy Coding!

2. This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.
    
        public class Multiply {
            public static Double multiply(Double a, Double b) {
            return a * b
            }
        }
    

3. Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.
   
        public class Kata {
            public static String evenOrOdd(int number) {
                return ""; // Place code here;
            }
        }
